## Hi, a brief introduction:

* ​I'm a physicist and I work in astrophysics, cosmology and gravitation.
* I'm an associate (permanent) professor at the Department of Physics, Federal University of Espírito Santo (UFES), Brazil.
* Here we have a center on research and science communication called Cosmo-Ufes. 
* We also have two postgraduate programs (for Masters and PhD) related to physics and astronomy: PPGCosmo and PPGFis. I have students in both of them, I was the coordinator of PPGFis from 2017 to 2019,  and since 2022 I am the vice-coordinator of PPGCosmo.
* I live in Vitória, the capital of the Espírito Santo (ES) state. I was not born here, and I find it a very pleasant and practical city. Here you can live in walking distance (15 min) to the beach and the university.
