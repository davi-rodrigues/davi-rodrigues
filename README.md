### Hi, a brief introduction:

* ​I'm a physicist and I work in astrophysics, cosmology and gravitation.
* I'm an associate (permanent) professor at the [Department of Physics](https://fisica.ufes.br/pt-br/docentes-e-tecnicos), Federal University of Espírito Santo (UFES), Brazil.
* Here in Github you can find several codes of mine that are mainly devoted to scientific computations.
* In case of doubts with these codes, or if you would like some piece of code that you cannot find here in Github, feel free to contact me (see my website below).
